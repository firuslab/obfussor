# Introduction

Welcome to the **Obfussor** documentation, a guide to LLVM-based obfuscation techniques.

LLVM obfuscation transforms code at the Intermediate Representation (IR) level to hinder reverse engineering. This book covers key obfuscation techniques, reverse engineering challenges, and practical examples.

## What is LLVM Obfuscation?

LLVM obfuscation is a technique used to make reverse engineering more difficult by transforming the code at the IR level. This includes:

- Control flow flattening
- Bogus control flow
- Instruction substitution

## Why Use LLVM Obfuscation?

- Protect intellectual property
- Prevent reverse engineering
- Enhance software security

## Tools and Techniques

Reverse engineering obfuscated LLVM code requires advanced tools like:

- **IDA Pro**
- **Ghidra**
- **Dynamic Binary Instrumentation**

## Audience

This book is intended for:

- Security researchers
- Reverse engineers
- Developers interested in code protection
